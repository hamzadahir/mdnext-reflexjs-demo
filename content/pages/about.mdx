<hr />

The `mdnext` CLI surfaces a collection officially maintained and community submitted templates to choose from. Once chosen, the project is cloned locally with a clean commit history and you're ready to build your next project.

```sh
# Using NPX we'll start up the mdnext CLI prompts --
npx mdnext

# You will first be prompted with.. --
What is the name of your project?

# Then you will choose which template to use
Select which template to use ...
```

The `mdnext` template collection are NextJS based projects with opinions around how to style, handle MDX (and other data sources), deliver media, and handle your most usual workflows (ecomm / blogs / product pages).
